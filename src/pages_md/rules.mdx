# Code of Conduct

The SIGPwny Code of Conduct serves to create a safe, friendly environment for everyone, whether it's in our meetings, events, or online spaces. By using our Discord and participating in our club events you agree to the following rules. Please report any misconduct to the admins via DMs or anonymously via this [Google Form](https://forms.gle/PGdwxrCFgDQRM9oX6).

1. **Be respectful**.  
Keep your messages civil and don't bully, troll, or harass others. Do not start needless arguments for the sake of arguing.
2. **Be inclusive**.  
Racist, sexist, anti-LGBTQ+, bigoted, and condescending messages are not tolerated. Promoting people or ideologies that allow these messages is also not accepted.
3. **Nothing illegal**.  
Do not perform, encourage, or discuss illegal activities. Do not doxx or reveal sensitive information belonging to others without their permission.
4. **No NSFW or suggestive content**.  
Nudity or gore is not allowed. If you have to ask, don't post it. Swearing is allowed as long as it follows all other rules.
5. **Don't spam**.  
This includes excessive messages, emojis, images, advertisements, and @mentions. If you want to promote something, ask an admin first.
6. **Use common sense**.  
The admins have the final say on misconduct and punishments given. This is a catch-all rule.
